Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes that this relationship is linear,; meaning that changes in the independent variables lead to proportional changes in the dependent variable. The model aims to find the best-fit line that minimizes the sum of squared differences between predicted and actual values. Linear regression is widely applied in various fields,; including economics,; finance,; and science,; to make predictions,; understand correlations,; and infer causal relationships. It serves as a basis for more complex regression techniques and is a valuable tool in data analysis and machine learning.
